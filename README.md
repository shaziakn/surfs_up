Findings: There are more days of precipitation in June than in December overall. However, the maximum precipitation
and average precipitation in inches is greater in December than in June, with more variation in December, according
to the higher standard deviation. For further analysis, I reccomend averaging the days of precipitation for June
and for December for each year and comparing the trends in the graph. This way, the investor will know how many days
he should expect to have the ice cream surf shop open or closed.
